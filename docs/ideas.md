# Ideas — skyrim-headless-mods

Future work, deferred features, and things worth revisiting. Each entry is WHAT, not HOW.

## 2026-06-17 — Ghidra RE tier + GhostAllies stream pass-through reopened

Set up a **headless, reproducible Ghidra tier** (`docs/ghidra.md`, `tools/ghidra/ghidra.sh`) to
disassemble `SkyrimSE.exe` for hook points the Address-Library tier can't reach. Two findings:

- **SkyrimSE.exe is SteamStub-DRM encrypted** (`.bind` section, Variant 3.1 x64): the on-disk
  `.text` is garbage until unpacked with Steamless (`ghidra.sh unpack`). Any prior *inference* about
  these functions' internals was made without ever seeing real code — suspect accordingly.
- **The "continuous streams can't pass through" parked reason is DISPROVEN.** Decompiling the
  decrypted `FlameProjectile::UpdateImpl` (vtable slot `0xAB`, VA `0x1407d5760`) shows it is
  **positioning + orientation + homing-target aim + lifetime** — matrix/transform math end to end
  (helpers `0x1401d0ec0` = 3×3 matmul, `0x140d19e40` = build-rotation-from-direction, `0x1407ecbf0`
  /`0x140851dc0` = compute the flame node transform / homing aim-point). **There is no
  layer-filtered world cast and no collision "stop point" anywhere in it** — contrary to
  `ghost-allies-design.md` §2b, which assumed (pre-Ghidra) the stop point was computed there. So the
  systemGroup family didn't fail because "the cast uses layer not group" — it failed because
  `UpdateImpl` does no collision at all. **Stream pass-through is therefore not proven infeasible.**
- **Next step (tractable now the pipeline works):** find where the flame's effective target is
  actually gated — almost certainly the **magic aim / target-acquisition** path (the flame homes
  toward an acquired ref; if the ally is acquired, the enemy behind is never targeted), not the
  projectile's own update. Trace that pick → decide buildable-vs-dead with a real seam, not a guess.
  Verify any candidate hook in-engine with `skytest test GhostAllies --headless`.

## 2026-06-16 — skytest replay follow-ups (feature built; staging model decided)

Replay machinery shipped & verified live; staging model settled in `docs/plans/
skytest-replay-handoff.md`. Deferred:

- **Direct-call staging probe commands (the agreed approach — not a blocker).** Programmatic
  console `exec` (`coc`/`placeatme`/`addspell`) faults — PINNED (`skytest/docs/headless-findings.md`
  #18): CommonLib mis-binds `CompileAndRun` on game 1.6.1170 (stale dependency, bound id absent), not
  a headless or missing-subsystem limit; would fault windowed too. By
  design the harness stages with **direct engine-call** SkytestProbe commands like the existing
  `give-spell`/`set-av` and drives input through the drive layer. Add `placeatme` / cell-travel
  (`coc`-equivalent via `PlayerCharacter::MoveTo`) / an `addspell` command **per-need** (when the
  GhostAllies summons replay needs them), then route replay staging to them (or add a `stage`
  step). Don't build the whole console surface speculatively, and don't try to "fix" `exec`.
- **Exterior `SkytestBase` save** (for a meaningful Map demo). The base save is in qasmoke
  (interior, no world map), so `tap m` renders black and the `MapMenu` gate is unreliable. An
  exterior save would make a real OneClickTravel-relevant map demo possible — but it changes
  shared test infra (every test autoloads `SkytestBase`), so it's a deliberate call.
- **~~Truncate `commands.jsonl` at session start.~~ DONE (2026-06-16).** Folded into a bigger fix:
  `gs_reset_io` now clears **both** `commands.jsonl` and `trace.jsonl` in `_boot_test_session`
  before `gs_launch`. The `trace.jsonl` half fixed a real bug — `gs_wait_ready`/replay gates were
  matching a **prior** session's last `inWorld:true` status line (the probe only truncates trace on
  load, after the readiness poll already ran), faking instant readiness and driving replay input
  before the EIS server was up. See the handoff's "stale-IO readiness" finding.
- **~~Validate key names in `tap`/`key` steps.~~ DONE (2026-06-16).** `gs_drive`'s `tap`/`seq`/`key`
  now capture `gs_keycode`'s rc (`kc=$(gs_keycode …) || return 2`) instead of inlining the
  substitution; an unknown key was producing an empty arg → `eidriver` tapped keycode 0 (a silent
  no-op that still exited 0), so a typo'd key reported `ok` and a downstream gate was what failed.
  `seq` validates every key before driving any (no half-applied sequence). **`hold` (2026-06-16
  audit):** it did the OPPOSITE of capturing the rc — it pre-resolved the name to a keycode and
  passed that to `gs_drive key`, which re-resolves name→code, so it double-resolved (`unknown key:
  18`), the press silently no-op'd, and the unchecked press rc hid it. Now `hold` passes the key
  *name* through and checks the press rc (handoff RESOLVED 4). **Parse-time presence checks: DONE
  (2026-06-16) —** a `tap`/`key`/`hold`/`wait` missing its required argument is now a `--dry-run`
  lint error (`line N`). Still deferred: validating key *names* at parse time (the original
  "stronger option"), which would couple the pure parser to `gs_keycode`.
- **`charged` / `actorcount` gates** (from the design) — not built; add per the first script that
  needs them, each as one `resolve_gate` row + one direct-call probe handler (the `is-menu-open`
  commit is the template).

## 2026-06-08 — GhostAllies (projectiles phase through followers)

State: **v1 + v2 shipped & verified in-game (v0.9.0, 2026-06-14)** (`docs/plans/
ghost-allies-design.md`). v2 delivered: arrows + aimed spells (Firebolt) pass through the whole
party; the player's hostile magic deals no friendly damage to teammates. Still deferred / parked:

- **Runes + wall spells.** `GrenadeProjectile` (runes / lobbed) and `BarrierProjectile` (wall
  spells) are explicitly out of v2 scope — different (arc / placed) collision feel. Add later by
  extending the same unified `UpdateImpl` stamp to those subclass vtables.
- **Broaden the "phase through" target set beyond teammates.** Player summons (atronachs,
  reanimated thralls) and optionally any non-hostile actor. v2 keys off `IsPlayerTeammate()`; each
  extra category is a different engine flag — fold them into the same "ghost group" membership set.
- **MCM / INI configuration.** Toggles for: arrows on/off, spells on/off, per-projectile-type, and
  which actor categories phase (teammates / summons / all non-hostiles). v2's membership set is
  already category-shaped, so this is mostly surfacing it as config (mirror the AutoFireBow INI
  decision below).
- **Continuous spells (Flames/Sparks): damage refused ✅, true pass-through PARKED (infeasible).**
  Damage is handled — `MagicTarget::AddTarget` refusal drops the player's hostile effects on
  teammates (verified; `AddImpact` 0xBD was tried first and disproven). But making the *stream pass
  through* the ally to hit the enemy behind is **structurally infeasible** (researched 2026-06-14, 4
  failed attempts incl. ghosting all the ally's rigid bodies, reverted in v0.9.0):
  `FlameProjectile`/`BeamProjectile` expose **no collision-point vfunc (slot 0xBE)** — their stop
  point is baked in non-virtual `UpdateImpl` via a **layer**-filtered cast that ignores systemGroup,
  and no mod has ever done it. Only experimental levers remain (flip the ally's collision *layer*
  during the cast — high blast radius; or Ghidra-disassemble `UpdateImpl` to trampoline the internal
  cast). See `docs/plans/ghost-allies-design.md` §2b. Don't retry the systemGroup family for streams.
- **ConeProjectile DOES expose 0xBE — cone pass-through could be feasible later.** Unlike flame/beam,
  `ConeProjectile` overrides the `0xBE` collision-point handler
  (`OnXxxCollision(Projectile*, hkpAllCdPointCollector*)`), so a cone spell could get *true*
  pass-through by hooking 0xBE and erasing teammate contacts (the community-standard discrete
  pass-through hook). Untested (no cone spell on hand). That same 0xBE contact-erase hook is also the
  cleaner/proper mechanism for arrow/missile pass-through than the current systemGroup stamp
  (precedents: D7ry/valhallaCombat, the local co-op mod) — worth knowing if the stamp ever regresses.

**Dropped, not deferred:** two-way phasing (follower-fired projectiles through the player).
Followers rarely friendly-fire the player, so it solves a non-problem. Only revisit if real
gameplay shows follower projectiles blocking/hitting the player often enough to matter.

## 2026-06-09 — OneClickTravel (skip world-map popups)

State: **v1 shipped + verified in-game 2026-06-14** (`docs/plans/oneclick-travel-design.md`).
Discovered-marker click → instant fast-travel, no confirm box; all other boxes pass through
vanilla. Built on a MinHook entry detour of `MessageBoxData::QueueMessage` (replaced the stopgap
`write_branch<5>` build that crashed on non-travel boxes). v1 is unconditional, no config. Deferred:

- **Modifier-key escape hatch.** v1 permanently trades away two vanilla options: "Place Marker" on
  a _discovered_ location (you always travel instead), and "Place marker? Yes/No" on an undiscovered
  location when a marker already exists (you get Move/Leave/Remove instead). Both were accepted, but
  a held modifier (e.g. Shift-click) could restore the old behavior on demand — Shift-click a
  discovered marker to place a marker on it; Shift-click an undiscovered location to place/relocate
  there directly. Adds a key-state check in the hook branch.
- **MCM / INI configuration.** Per-behavior toggles: instant-travel on/off, instant-place on/off,
  and whether to remap box #3 (undiscovered-location + marker-exists → management menu) or leave it
  vanilla. Mirror the AutoFireBow INI decision below (SimpleIni in the DLL, no esp/Papyrus).
- **Confirm-on-condition.** Optional re-introduction of a confirm only for long-distance travel, or
  only when carrying a quest-relevant timer — niche, revisit only if play shows accidental travel is
  a real annoyance.

## 2026-06-08 — AutoFireBow config (deferred)

> **Superseded 2026-06-14 by `docs/plans/autofirebow-mcm-design.md`.** The "how" below chose an
> **INI read by the DLL** to stay zero-dependency; the user has since chosen a real in-game **SkyUI
> MCM** (no MCM Helper) instead, accepting SkyUI as a hard dependency. The settings list below still
> stands (master on/off, toggle hotkey, damage-bonus slider, min-shot-delay cadence cap) — only the
> delivery mechanism changed. The INI route and the other menu options are recorded as "Alternatives
> considered" in the design doc.

Make the mod configurable instead of always-on. Settings worth exposing:

- **Master on/off**, plus a configurable **toggle hotkey**.
- **Auto-fire** on/off independently of **full-power clamp** on/off — they're separate mechanisms
  in the code (`BowLoopSink` vs `PowerSpeedHook`), so some users will want one without the other.
  **Contingent:** the real-charge spike (`docs/plans/autofirebow-real-charge-design.md`) aims to
  _delete_ `PowerSpeedHook` outright. If it lands, there's no clamp left to toggle — auto-fire just
  looses honestly-charged shots, and this split collapses to a single auto-fire on/off.
- _(maybe)_ min delay between auto-shots — a cadence cap.

Gating is cheap: a few `bool` globals checked in `PowerSpeedHook::thunk` and the `BowDrawn` handler.

**Decision (how):** ship config as an **INI read by the DLL** (SimpleIni ships with CommonLib) +
the toggle **hotkey** wired into the existing `AttackInputSink`. Zero new user dependencies, no
`.esp`, stays in the pure-C++ tier. Settings are global (not per-save) — correct for an on/off mod.

**Considered and rejected for v1:**

- _Classic SkyUI MCM (Papyrus)_ — needs an esp + `.pex` extending `SKI_ConfigBase` + SkyUI + a
  C++↔Papyrus bridge. Drags the Papyrus tier back into a pure-C++ plugin. Worst fit.
- _MCM Helper_ — no Papyrus authoring (generic script), familiar Esc→Mod Configuration UX, but
  pulls in SkyUI + MCM Helper as required mods and still needs a tiny ESL. Revisit only if release
  comments ask for a real in-game menu.
- _SKSE Menu Framework (ImGui)_ — pure C++, no esp/SkyUI/Papyrus, menu rendered from the DLL;
  architecturally the cleanest fit, but niche UX and small install base. Skipped for familiarity.

## 2026-06-09 — headless driver (testing harness)

New `headless/` subsystem: run Skyrim invisibly in headless `gamescope`, screenshot it
(SIGUSR2→AVIF), inject isolated input via **libei**.

> **Superseded 2026-06-12:** `headless/` was merged into `skytest/` — one tool, where `test` runs a
> drivable gamescope session (visible by default, `--headless` for no window). The dead-ends doc moved
> to `skytest/docs/headless-findings.md`; the design/status content folded into `skytest/README.md`.
> The libei **pointer** dead-end is resolved (relative motion, measured 1:1 — findings #9), and the
> end-to-end keyboard run works (`skytest ready`/`drive`).

Still open:

- **Isolate the Saves folder per test (shared-folder autoload blocker).** The Saves dir lives in the
  prefix and is shared across profiles, so a vanilla+1 `test` game's "Continue" auto-checks the newest
  save (your _main modded_ save) and pops a "missing content" modal that blocks po3 StartOnSave from
  autoloading `SkytestBase` (which is itself clean — vanilla + Creation Club only). Fix direction:
  point Saves at an isolated dir for the test (only `SkytestBase` visible), or dismiss the modal once
  precise menu `drive` works. **Note (2026-06-14):** `skytest playtest` (drivable _full_ profile)
  sidesteps this for MCM / load-order-dependent tests — the full load order matches the real saves, so
  `CONTINUE` loads with no modal. The isolation fix is still wanted for vanilla+1 `test` autoload.
- **~~`drive` keyboard didn't move the menu~~ — RESOLVED 2026-06-14 (keyboard).** In-world keyboard
  driving is confirmed end-to-end via `playtest` (main-menu `CONTINUE` → confirm → save load →
  in-world → journal, every `drive tap` registering); #13's failure was the no-content _modal_
  swallowing keys, not keyboard in general. **Still open:** precise in-menu **mouse** clicks — the
  #9b cursor desync still misses (couldn't click the Journal's SYSTEM tab to reach Mod Configuration),
  so visual MCM screenshots need the cursor-sync fix. Also still pending: `shot`/`drive` under
  `--backend wayland`. Detail: `skytest/docs/headless-findings.md` #14.
- **SKSE ground-truth tie-in** (endgame): in-process plugin reports real state (`UI::IsMenuOpen`,
  player pos, menu stack) and activates menus via engine calls — gamescope = eyes, SKSE = deterministic
  hands. Removes pixel-reading and the OS-input problem entirely.

## 2026-06-10 — DBVODialogueTweaks v2 / v3 (deferred phases)

The mod (renamed from `DBVOResponseGap`) ships in phases. v1 (manual player-line skip), **v2**
(configurable response gap — `docs/plans/dbvo-v2-configurable-gap-design.md`), and **v3** (player-voice
volume slider — `docs/plans/dbvo-v3-player-voice-volume-design.md`, the first SKSE-tier feature) all
shipped, verified in-game. Deferred:

- **v2 → public Nexus release (post-v2 follow-up).** v2 builds self-first; releasing it publicly is a
  clean separate pass once the mechanism is proven in-game. **Unlocked:** DBVO's page grants
  modify-and-release with credit, and DBVO is a frozen target (~3 yr, won't bitrot) — see mod README
  "Permissions". Release pass = ship the built modified swf + ESL + MCM, credit the DBVO author, write a
  Nexus page, and test beyond the DBVO+Karat setup (a few more voice packs). No architectural change.
- **v3+ → v4 — cut the voice on skip: SHIPPED (2026-06-14, verified in-game).** Both halves done:
  the **player line** is cut on skip (the v3 `Actor::SpeakSoundFunction` hook now retains the line's
  `BSSoundHandle` → `FadeOutAndRelease` on skip), and the **NPC reply** is cut on new-topic interrupt —
  including multi-segment replies — via the speaker's `ExtraSayToTopicInfo.sound` +
  `Actor::PauseCurrentDialogue`. Full architecture **and the dead-ends** (`PauseCurrentDialogue` only
  _pauses_; `HighProcessData::soundHandles` aren't the topic voice; the NPC reply isn't a DBVO
  SpeakSound; and the facegen freeze — the NPC mouth/face freezes open on cut and is reset to neutral
  in `CutNpcReply()` via a lock-guarded snap `Reset`) live in
  `docs/plans/dbvo-v4-voice-cut-on-skip-design.md`. Still deferred on this tier:
  - **Exact NPC-reply scheduling — v5 SHIPPED & verified in-game 2026-06-14**
    (design `docs/plans/dbvo-v5-reply-on-line-end-design.md`, plan `…-plan.md`). Realized as
    **end-detection** rather than duration-prediction: a detached poll thread watches the retained
    `g_playerLine` handle and fires the reply (via `GFxMovieView::InvokeNoReturn` into the swf's new
    `dbvoOnPlayerLineEnded`) the moment the line stops, after a small configurable gap. Drops v2's
    ms-per-word slider, repurposes the pad slider as the trailing gap, keeps a generous internal swf
    backstop for the missing-audio case. **Two in-game gotchas fixed during bring-up** (both in the
    design's "Dead-ends"): (1) the watcher was first a self-re-arming main-thread `AddTask` loop and
    **froze the game for the whole line** — SKSE drains its task queue to empty, so a self-re-queuing
    task spins the frame; moved the poll to a detached thread (sleep), marshalling only the one-shot
    fire. (2) MCM made **tab-less** to mirror DBVO's own menu — leave `Pages` unset (Papyrus forbids a
    0-length array; `GetVersion` 4 clears persisted tabs via `Pages = None`), render both sliders on the
    landing page. Duration-prediction (read the `.fuz`/`.xwm` length up front) is kept in the design as
    a fallback only if detection proves flaky.
- **v1 fallback to fold in:** if E/activate can't be routed from the swf during `TOPIC_CLICKED`, v1
  ships left-click-only and the keyboard skip moves to a v3 SKSE input hook.

## 2026-06-11 — DBVODialogueTweaks v3 volume-slider follow-ups

- **Boost-clamp: RESOLVED → slider capped at 0–100%.** In-game 150% testing confirmed
  `BSSoundHandle::SetVolume(>1.0)` does **not** amplify — 150% was indistinguishable from 100% (engine
  handle volumes are 0.0–1.0 multipliers). Attenuation works fully (50% quieter, 0% silent, NPC reply
  unchanged, survives save/reload). The slider now caps at 100%. If voice _boost_ is ever wanted it needs
  a different gain path (re-encode the Karat pack louder offline, or a custom audio output model) — not
  worth it for the "tame it" goal. See `docs/plans/dbvo-v3-player-voice-volume-design.md` → "Value
  mapping & the boost caveat".

## 2026-06-11 — SkytestProbe (runtime-commandable debug instrumentation)

State: **v1 designed** (`docs/plans/skytest-probe-design.md`), no separate plan — implementation
works straight from the design doc. Deferred beyond v1:

- **Full command bridge (socket/RPC).** v1's file protocol already makes the running game
  externally scriptable; a socket would add request/response semantics and lower latency. Only
  worth it if file polling proves limiting.
- **Curated runtime-toggleable hook probes.** Pre-compiled trampoline hooks on commonly-debugged
  engine functions (damage application, projectile spawn, …), armed via command — the safe
  subset of "dynamic tracing". Arbitrary-address hooking stays out (crash-prone).
- **Console output capture for `exec`.** v1 is fire-and-forget; capturing what the command
  printed (hook `ConsoleLog::Print`?) would make `exec` a query tool (`GetAV`, `GetStage`, …).
- **Papyrus script-variable peeking.** Visibility into running Papyrus state from the C++ side.
- **Per-mod fixture autoexec convention.** `exec` covers the mechanics; define where a
  mod-under-test's fixture script lives so `skytest test <mod>` arms it automatically
  (the deferred per-mod-fixtures item from the skytest v2 handoff).
- **Per-frame `watch` sampling** via a `Main::Update` hook, if 4 Hz poll cadence proves too
  coarse for spiky values.
- **Editor-ID / plugin-relative ref addressing** (`"MyMod.esp|0xD62"`) in addition to runtime
  FormIDs.
- **DLL hot-reload of the mod-under-test.** Would kill the remaining restart-on-fix cost;
  generally unsafe (static state, irreversible hooks) — research only if restarts become the
  bottleneck again.

## 2026-06-12 — skytest relocation follow-ups

`skytest` moved from `~/Downloads/skyrim-mods/1-skytest/` into this repo (`skytest/`) so that
mod-_making_ and mod-_managing_ are cleanly separated by directory. The move was pure (no script
changes). Follow-ups it opened up:

- **~~Merge `headless/` + `skytest/` into one launcher~~ — DESIGNED 2026-06-12**
  (`docs/plans/headless-skytest-merge-design.md`), not yet built. A _test session_ runs under
  gamescope (visible `--backend wayland` or `--headless`) — detached, drivable (`skytest shot`/
  `drive`/`ready`/`stop`), restore-on-`stop`; `play`/`normal` keep the bare direct fast path
  (blocking, restore-on-exit, not drivable). The visible test runs under gamescope so `drive`/`shot`
  reuse the exact headless machinery; `--headless` just swaps the backend string. `headless/` retires
  into `skytest/lib/gamescope.sh` + `skytest/eidriver/`. Implementation plan is the next step.
- **~~De-duplicate `SkytestProbe.dll`~~ — RESOLVED 2026-06-12.** `skytest` now reads the probe DLL +
  ini straight from its build output (`mods/SkytestProbe/build/SkytestProbe.dll` + `mods/SkytestProbe/
SkytestProbe.ini`); the committed copy under `skytest/base-skse/` and `build.sh --stage` are both
  gone, so the build output is the single canonical copy — no tracked binary duplicate.
  (`po3_StartOnSave.{dll,ini.template}` stays vendored in `base-skse/` — genuinely third-party, no
  in-repo source.)

## 2026-06-12 — headless+skytest merge follow-ups

Deferred out of the merge design (`docs/plans/headless-skytest-merge-design.md`, "merge only" scope):

- **Input recording / playback.** The motivating use case for `shot`/`drive` being first-class
  skytest verbs. CC drives a (visible) gamescope test session to a target state — e.g. navigate
  menus, click a discovered map marker — using screenshots as the authoring aid (_see_ where the
  marker is, decide the click). The input step sequence is **recorded** to a file, then **replayed**
  deterministically to re-reach that state for testing/probing (replay → probe the result, no human
  in the loop). Its own design space, deferred deliberately: the step-file format, how playback
  re-times/re-syncs steps, how it tolerates the game booting slower one run to the next, and the
  screenshot-assisted authoring loop. The merge shapes `drive` to stay replay-friendly so this layer
  bolts on without reworking the input path. Pairs with the SKSE ground-truth tie-in (probe `status`
  as the per-step sync gate instead of fixed sleeps).

  > **DESIGNED 2026-06-16 — the step-file half** (`docs/plans/skytest-replay-design.md`). The
  > CC-authored step-script format + `skytest replay <mod> <script>` interpreter is designed:
  > line-based `.steps` files (`exec`/`tap`/`key`/`hold`/`wait`/`shot`), probe-gated `until:` sync
  > (reuses `IsInWorld`; `menu`/`charged`/`actorcount` gates added to SkytestProbe **permanently**
  > as scripts first need them — no speculative vocabulary), replay reaches a target state and leaves
  > the session detached for live probing (no baked-in verdict). **Still deferred:** _raw
  > human-input capture_ — a person physically plays, raw libei events recorded + wall-clock
  > re-synced; this is the camera/pointer-motion path, its own harder feature (the designed half is
  > discrete input only, CC-driven). A _tee-recorder_ (auto-log my `drive`/`exec` into a draft) was
  > considered and **dropped** — rationale in the design doc's "author, not capture" section.

## 2026-06-14 — SkytestProbe MCM reveal/drive

State: **reveal v1 designed** (`docs/plans/skytest-probe-mcm-reveal-design.md`) — read-only `mcm-list`
(enumerate registered MCMs + pages) + `mcm-get <ConfigScript> <prop…>` (a known mod's live property
values), both headless via the Papyrus VM, targeting the full profile. Deferred:

- **`mcm-scrape` — generic on-screen option labels + values.** Reads whatever MCM page is currently
  **open**, via a Scaleform/GFx scrape of the "Journal Menu" (`_root.ConfigPanelFader.configPanel`).
  Menu-open-only by nature (SkyUI builds option values only while a page renders — there is no central
  value table), and needs a one-time runtime `VisitMembers` dump to discover SkyUI's flash option-array
  path (the `.as` source isn't vendored). It's the generic-values complement to v1's known-mod `mcm-get`.
- **Drive MCMs from C++ (the follow-up phase).** Open a config / select a page / set an option without
  pixel input — via `GFxMovie::Invoke` on SkyUI's flash methods or `SendModEvent` of the `SKICP_*`
  events (`SKICP_optionSelected`, `SKICP_pageSelected`, …). Built on the same open-menu GFx plumbing as
  `mcm-scrape`. This is what fully replaces the unreliable cursor-driving of MCMs (the AutoFireBow MCM
  test wall — `skytest/docs/headless-findings.md` #14).
- **`skytest playtest --probe`.** Inject SkytestProbe into the otherwise-pristine full `playtest`
  session so MCM reveal needs no manual install of the probe into the full profile. A skytest-side
  convenience, not part of the probe feature.

## 2026-06-14 — skytest test mis-stages split-output mods (e.g. DBVODialogueTweaks)

`skytest test <mod>` expects the mod arg to be a single artifact (`.dll`/`.esp`) **or a Data-shaped
folder** — `build_test_profile` (`skytest:221-229`) just mirrors `find "$mod" -type f` verbatim into
the test profile, assuming every file already sits at its `Data/`-relative path. DBVODialogueTweaks
fits neither: its outputs are split across `build/` (`Interface/`, `Scripts/`, the `.esp`) and
`plugin/build/` (the DLL), and the repo dir itself isn't Data-shaped. So
`skytest test mods/DBVODialogueTweaks` symlinks repo files (`src/`, `docs/`, `build.sh`) into the
profile at junk paths, places the esp at `Data/build/DBVODialogueTweaks.esp` (game can't find it), and
**never stages the DLL** (it lives outside any path skytest mirrors to `SKSE/Plugins/`). Observed
2026-06-14: in a `skytest test mods/DBVODialogueTweaks --headless` run, SkytestProbe/CrashLogger logged
fresh but `DBVODialogueTweaks.dll` never loaded (its SKSE log stayed stale). Even pointing at `build/`
alone would still miss the DLL (`plugin/build/`).

Directions: (a) have `build.sh` emit one **Data-shaped** staging dir (e.g. `build/Data/` with
`SKSE/Plugins/<dll>` + `Interface/` + `Scripts/` + the `.esp`) and point `skytest test` at that;
(b) teach skytest to assemble a mod's Data image from build.sh's known outputs; or (c) pass the DLL via
`--with` plus a Data-shaped dir for the rest. Lower priority for DBVODialogueTweaks itself — it needs
DBVO + a voice pack present, so it's a **full-profile** test regardless — but it bites any future
swf+DLL+esp mod that *is* standalone vanilla+1-testable.

## 2026-06-14 — AutoCastSpell (deferred phases)

State: **v1 SHIPPED & verified in-engine** (`mods/AutoCastSpell/`, always-on standalone SKSE DLL;
spell analog of AutoFireBow). Hold a fire-and-forget spell → auto-fires at full charge, loops until
released, per hand / dual-cast. The loop is driven by polling `RE::MagicCaster::state` (no "spell
charged" anim event exists): kReady→synthetic release, re-arm on the next charge + a release-nudge
fallback. Verified: right/left/both loops, concentration excluded, magicka-out clean stall.
Deferred out of v1:

- **Replace the load-bearing per-cycle logging with explicit pacing.** The loop currently *depends*
  on the per-cycle `SKSE::log::info` calls: their `flush_on(info)` disk-flush spaces the synthetic
  injects from the state re-reads, which the timing-sensitive recharge needs. Stripping the logging
  regressed the loop (7 casts → 2). It works, but it's fragile (a read-only log dir or an spdlog flush
  change would alter timing) and it spams the log every cast. Replace the flush-as-pacing with an
  explicit, deliberate delay/spacing in `CheckCasters` (or spread the inject vs. re-read across poll
  ticks), then drop the verbose logging — and re-validate on real hardware with the *same* hold test.
- **SkyUI MCM (the config follow-up).** Mirror AutoFireBow's MCM: master on/off, a toggle hotkey,
  and a **min-cast-delay** cadence cap. The cadence cap matters more here than for the bow — magicka
  drains fast, so the first MCM knob is the per-cast delay to avoid dumping the whole pool instantly.
  Bolts on cleanly once the v1 loop is proven (AutoFireBow's exact evolution: always-on → MCM).
- **Magicka-out "still-held" watchdog.** v1 stalls the loop mid-stream when a charge can't be
  afforded (the engine never emits the "charged" event, so no release/re-press) — the player releases
  and re-presses to resume once magicka regens. A watchdog that re-attempts the charge while the
  control is still held would auto-resume on regen without the manual re-press. Adds off-thread-safe
  timing (enqueue the retry press on the game thread); deferred as a polish nicety, not v1.
- **Public Nexus release.** Like the other mods, a clean separate pass once the loop is proven
  in-game — write a page, test beyond the Firebolt close-out (a few more FF spell types: runes,
  summons, dual-cast). No architectural change.

## 2026-06-14 — Per-mod READMEs for the remaining code mods

State: **GhostAllies README done** — it was the acute gap (the root `README.md` headline link
called GhostAllies "the flagship working mod" but `mods/GhostAllies/` had no README, so on GitHub
the link opened a bare source dir). DBVO and RapidBowHold already have mod READMEs. Still missing a
mod `README.md` landing page for the other working code mods:

- **AutoFireBow** — working SKSE C++ mod, release-bound (Nexus messaging drafted in
  `docs/autofirebow-nexus-page.md`); a proper mod README is the natural landing page.
- **AutoCastSpell** — working SKSE C++ mod (v1).
- **SkytestProbe** — working SKSE C++ debug toolkit; a README would double as its usage / command
  reference (the command set currently only lives in `docs/plans/skytest-probe-design.md`).
- **OneClickTravel** — **DONE** (`mods/OneClickTravel/README.md`, 2026-06-14). Release artifacts also
  ready: `package.sh` → `dist/` zip + Nexus page copy (`docs/oneclicktravel-nexus-page.md`); awaiting
  only a header image + the manual Nexus upload.

Each should mirror the DBVO/GhostAllies README shape (what it does / requirements / compatibility /
install / how it works / build) and **move the detailed prose out of the root README table** into
the mod README, leaving the root row a brief pointer — exactly as GhostAllies now does. Pure docs,
low risk. For a showcase repo, consistent per-mod landing pages remove the last "looks half-done"
signal once a browser clicks into each mod dir.
