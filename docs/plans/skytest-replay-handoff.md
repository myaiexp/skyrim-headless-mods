# skytest replay — session handoff (2026-06-16)

Mid-feature handoff. The replay **machinery is built, committed, and verified live**. The two
items once flagged as "blockers" — console `exec` and the qasmoke map demo — are **resolved**
(2026-06-16), see below. No open decision blocks the feature.

**Resolution in one line:** `exec` is *not a bug to fix in replay* — the harness stages world state
through **direct engine-call probe commands** (`give-spell`/`set-av`, with `coc`/`placeatme` added
per-need) and drives input through the **headless drive layer**. The `exec` fault was later PINNED
(2026-06-16, `skytest/docs/headless-findings.md` #18): CommonLib mis-binds `CompileAndRun` on game
1.6.1170 because this CommonLib build predates that runtime and the bound Address Library id is
absent — so it is a dependency version skew, **not** headless and **not** a missing subsystem, and
it would fault in a windowed game too. The map demo isn't blocked either: it just needs a per-need
`coc` direct-call command + an exterior to travel to. (The forensic detail below predates the pin
and its *cause* analysis is superseded by #18; kept as the record of how it was diagnosed.)

Spec: `skytest-replay-design.md`. Plan: `skytest-replay-plan.md`.

## What shipped (Tasks 1–5 + the verb) — committed to master

All verified against a running **headless** session (one full `skytest replay` run, plus
isolated probes). Commits (local-only, not pushed — see "git" below):

- `feat(skytest): .steps parser for replay (replay_parse)` — parser + `lib/replay.test.sh`
- `feat(skytestprobe): is-menu-open query — first accreted replay gate` (Task 5)
- `feat(skytest): probe-gated replay waits + data-driven gate table` (Task 2)
- `feat(skytest): replay step interpreter + button-hold input wiring` (Task 3)
- `feat(skytest): replay verb — boot reuse + arg/script resolution` (Task 4)
- `fix(skytest): absolutize replay script path before boot's cd`

**Verified working end-to-end** (`skytest replay <mod> skytest/examples/format-demo.steps --headless`):
parse → `_boot_test_session` (boots identically to `test`, reached in-world) → `until:inworld`
gate → `tap tilde` (libei input lands) → `until:menu:Console` gate (the Task 5 `is-menu-open`
probe; confirmed `Console open:true`) → `shot` (wrote the frame, console-open warning visible)
→ exit 0, session left live. `--dry-run`, bare/path/`-`-stdin script resolution, and
"abort leaves the session live" all confirmed. `skytest test` still boots to in-world post
`_boot_test_session` refactor (no regression).

`SkytestProbe.dll` rebuilt with `is-menu-open` (clean PE32+; warnings are pre-existing
CommonLib header noise).

## RESOLVED 1 — console `exec` is not the staging path (use direct-call)

> **Resolution (PINNED 2026-06-16, supersedes the forensic notes below):** not a replay bug, and
> not a headless/console-subsystem issue. Programmatic `exec` AVs at `SkyrimSE.exe+0xce9843`
> reading -1, identically with the console menu open and `ConsoleLog` non-null — so the

> Root cause: this CommonLibSSE-NG (v3.7.0-129, Sep 2024) predates the 1.6.1170 runtime;
> `CompileAndRun`'s bound AE id 21890 is absent from `versionlib-1-6-1170`, and CommonLib's non-VR
> id lookup silently resolves a missing id to the next id → wrong function → AV. It would fault in
> a windowed 1.6.1170 game too. Full proof: `skytest/docs/headless-findings.md` #18. The fix is
> still direct-call probe staging (more reliable here regardless); `exec` is retired, not fixed.
> Confirmed against the AutoCastSpell session (2026-06-14), which hit the identical `exec` fault
> and resolved it the same way (it built `give-spell`/`set-av` after `exec player.addspell` AV'd).

`exec <console>` faults: `exec: CompileAndRun faulted (console subsystem unavailable?)`.
Confirmed in **both headless AND visible** gamescope, **fully in-world** (`status` acks ok,
`inWorld:true`). Opening the console first (tilde → `Console open:true`) does **not** help.
(Superseded: the reason it doesn't help is the stale CommonLib binding, #18 — NOT an absent
compiler subsystem; the compiler is present, the call just lands on the wrong function.)

It is a **pre-existing** fault, not a replay bug (SEH-guarded in `SafeCompileAndRun`; `GiveSpell`/
`SetAV` exist precisely because staging goes through engine calls). _The original "console-less
environment / absent compiler subsystem" framing once cited here from `headless-findings` and
`skytest-probe-design` was **wrong** and those docs have been corrected — see the pinned cause in
`skytest/docs/headless-findings.md` #18 (stale CommonLib binding on 1.6.1170)._

**Why it bites replay specifically:** the design's world-staging premise is `exec coc` /
`exec player.placeatme` / `exec player.addspell` (the GhostAllies summons setup). None of
those run via console here. Earlier mods never hit this because they staged via direct-call
probe commands, not console.

**Recommended fix (per the repo's own pattern): direct-call staging, added per-need.**
Add SkytestProbe commands that do the staging via engine calls on the main thread, mirroring
`GiveSpell`/`SetAV`. Needed for the GhostAllies test:
- `addspell` → already have `engine::GiveSpell` (wire a command to it).
- `placeatme` → `RE::TESDataHandler`/`PlaceObjectAtMe` or `TESObjectREFR::PlaceObjectAtMe`.
- `coc`/cell-travel → `PlayerCharacter::MoveTo` a cell's COC marker, or `CenterOnCell`-style.
Then `replay`'s `exec` either routes recognized verbs to these, OR add a new step type
(e.g. `stage <cmd> …`) that maps to direct-call commands. Build these **when the GhostAllies
session needs them** (YAGNI, same as gates) — do NOT speculatively build the whole console
surface. Until then, replay does input + gates + shot, not console staging.

(To actually restore `exec` — not needed, since direct-call staging is the design: update
CommonLibSSE-NG to a build matching the 1.6.1170 runtime, or hardcode the correct 1.6.1170
`CompileAndRun` offset in the probe. See `skytest/docs/headless-findings.md` #18.)

## RESOLVED 2 — Map demo just needs a per-need `coc` + exterior (not blocked)

> **Resolution (2026-06-16):** not a blocker — deferred polish. A real Map demo needs an exterior;
> with the direct-call staging model that's just a per-need `coc`-equivalent command
> (`PlayerCharacter::MoveTo` an exterior cell) built when a OneClickMap/Travel replay actually
> wants it, plus an exterior fixture. Until then the committed `format-demo.steps` proves the
> mechanism via the Console menu. The detail below stays for whoever builds the map demo.

`SkytestBase` autoloads into **qasmoke** (interior test cell, no world map). So:
- `tap m` there renders a **black** map and the `MapMenu` gate was unreliable (`open:false`).
- `tap q` (Favorites) also probed `open:false`.
- Only **Console** (tilde) opened reliably (`open:true`) — that's what the committed
  `format-demo.steps` uses, as a mechanism proof.

Mase wanted a **Map** demo (genuinely useful for OneClickTravel/OneClickMap). A meaningful
map needs an **exterior** location, which needs either:
- (a) an **exterior `SkytestBase`** save (re-run `skytest setup-save`, `coc`/walk outside a
  city, `save SkytestBase`) — but it changes shared test infra (every test autoloads it); or
- (b) direct-call cell-travel (Blocker 1's `coc` equivalent) to move to an exterior at replay
  time.

**Decision (made 2026-06-16):** ship without console `exec`; staging is direct-call probe commands
added per-need (don't "fix" `exec`, don't pre-build the whole console surface). Demo path: keep the
Console mechanism-proof (`format-demo.steps`); build the exterior Map demo later when a
OneClickMap/Travel replay needs it (per-need `coc` command + exterior fixture).

## RESOLVED 3 — stale probe IO faked instant readiness (replay broke on the 2nd run) — FIXED 2026-06-16

> Found in the 2026-06-16 **test+audit** pass. The "`commands.jsonl` is never truncated /
> harmless-ish" note below **understated it**: the sibling `trace.jsonl` has the *same*
> never-truncated lifetime, and that one was **not** harmless — it broke `skytest replay`
> (and `test` readiness, and any `until:inworld` gate) on every run after a session that ended
> in-world. **Fixed** by `gs_reset_io` (clears both files in `_boot_test_session` before
> `gs_launch`). Verified: replay went from a 0.129s false boot → a real 27.97s boot
> (`booting → main-menu → in-world`), all 4 `format-demo.steps` steps green, `rc=0`.

**Root cause.** `gs_wait_ready` (and `replay_wait_gate` for `until:inworld`) `grep … | tail -1`
the last `"src":"status"` line in `trace.jsonl`. The probe only truncates `trace.jsonl` when it
*loads* (rotates it to `trace.prev.jsonl`, `trace.cpp:56/62`) — seconds into boot. The readiness
poll runs *immediately* after `gs_launch`, in the window **before** the probe loads, so it reads
the **prior** session's last line. That line is `inWorld:true` whenever the previous session ended
in-world (which `replay`/`test` leave it doing). Result: readiness returns instantly, replay races
ahead, and `tap` fails `failed to connect to EIS socket` because the compositor's EIS server isn't
up yet. Smoking gun: `trace.prev.jsonl` ended `{"inWorld":true,"mainMenu":false,"is3D":true}`.

**Also (the original, milder half):** a fresh probe re-reads `commands.jsonl` from offset 0 and
re-runs the **entire** command history (re-faulting old `exec`s, flooding the new trace). Same fix
clears it too. Done; `docs/ideas.md` item closed.

## RESOLVED 4 — `hold <key>` double-resolved the keycode (silent no-op) — FIXED 2026-06-16

> Found in the 2026-06-16 **replay audit** pass. `hold <LMB|RMB>` was fine; `hold <KEY>` (any
> keyboard key — `hold tilde …`, `hold w …`) **never pressed the key**, and reported the step OK.
> The `tap`/`key` key-name guard (RESOLVED-adjacent, "Next steps" item 2) did **not** cover it —
> `hold` bypassed the guard by pre-resolving. **Fixed** in `_replay_step_hold` (lib/replay.sh).

**Root cause — double resolution.** For a keyboard key, `_replay_step_hold` resolved the name to a
keycode itself (`kc="$(gs_keycode "$target")"`) and then called `gs_drive key "$kc" 1`. But
`gs_drive`'s `key` subcommand **also** resolves its first arg name→code (`gs_keycode "$1"`), exactly
like `tap`/`seq`. So it re-ran `gs_keycode 18` → `unknown key: 18` → rc 2, **before** the eidriver
call. The press (and release) silently no-op'd. Worse, `_replay_step_hold` did **not** check the
press rc, so the failure was swallowed: with the gate/sleep succeeding, the step returned 0 and
`replay` logged `step N ok: hold` while the key was never held. (`LMB`/`RMB` escaped this because
they use the `btn` subcommand, which takes raw 272/273 codes and never re-resolves.)

The unit harness **masked** it: it stubs `gs_drive` (so the second resolution never runs) and the
assertion baked in the pre-resolved code (`drive key 18 1`). `hold` was also "wired, not shown" in
`format-demo.steps` and never run live before this audit — so the bug shipped unobserved.

**Fix.** Pass the key **name** to `gs_drive key` (single resolution, same as `tap`/`seq`), and
**check the press rc** so a bad name / dead socket aborts *before* the gate instead of burning the
timeout. Verified live (headless): `hold tilde until:menu:Console` → press lands, Console opens, gate
satisfies in ~1 poll (no 180 s hang), release sent, `shot` shows the console-open warning. Repro
before the fix: `skytest drive key e 1` → ok; `skytest drive key 18 1` → `unknown key: 18` (the exact
internal call `hold` made). Unit test updated to assert the **name** is emitted + a new case locks in
the press-failure abort; `bash skytest/lib/replay.test.sh` → 27 passed.

---

## Audit polish — three smaller fixes from the same 2026-06-16 pass

All from the replay audit's "minor observations" (the `exec`/CompileAndRun fault was deliberately
left as the bigger separate issue). Unit suite now **35 passed**.

- **Parse-time presence validation.** A `tap`/`key` with no key, or a `hold`/`wait` missing its
  gate/target, used to slip through the parser and either silently no-op or fail with a confusing
  runtime error. The parser now rejects them as a lint (`replay: line N: 'tap' needs a key`, etc.),
  exit 2 — caught by `--dry-run` before any boot. Key-*name* validation stays deferred (parser↔
  `gs_keycode` coupling); this is structural-presence only. Tests added per step.
- **`shot` stdout no longer polluted.** `gs_shot` echoes the written path on stdout; in a replay run
  that spliced a bare `/tmp/…png` line into stdout between the `skytest:`/`replay:` messages. The
  `shot` step now captures it and reports `replay: shot -> <path>` on **stderr** with the rest.
  Verified headless: stdout carries no stray path; stderr shows the line.
- **Historical: full-profile wrapper help was added.** The now-removed full-profile wrapper was
  dispatchable and in `init`'s "next steps" but had no `verb_help` case (fell through to generic
  help) and was absent from the main verb list. That was fixed at the time; the wrapper has since
  been removed from the public CLI.
---

## Gotchas for the next session

- **`_boot_test_session` cd's to `$SKYDIR`** (via `gs_launch`→`skse_env_export`) before
  `replay_run` reads the script — that's why script paths are realpath'd up front in
  `cmd_replay`. Any new path the interpreter reads at run time must likewise be absolute.
- **`set -e` + non-zero return:** `_boot_test_session` returns 1 (timed out) / 10 (NO_LAUNCH);
  callers use `|| brc=$?` so set -e doesn't exit on it. Keep that idiom for any new such call.
- **`lib/replay.test.sh`** is the no-game unit harness (parser + gate resolver + interpreter
  stream via stubbed `gs_drive`/`_probe_send`/`replay_wait_gate`/`_replay_wait_ack`). Run
  `bash skytest/lib/replay.test.sh` — 25 assertions, all green. Extend it when you add steps.
- **Adding a gate = one row in `resolve_gate` (lib/replay.sh) + one direct-call probe handler**
  (the `is-menu-open` commit is the template). `charged`/`actorcount` from the design are NOT
  built — add them when a script first needs them.
- **`is-menu-open` menu names:** `Console`, `MapMenu`, `FavoritesMenu`, etc. (CommonLib
  `RE::*::MENU_NAME`). Verified the probe reports them correctly.

---

## Next steps (suggested order)

Both "blockers" are decided (see above) — what remains is per-need build-out:

1. When a GhostAllies / OneClickMap replay needs it: add `coc`/`placeatme`/`addspell` direct-call
   probe commands (+ exterior fixture for a Map demo), then route replay staging to them (or add a
   `stage` step). Per-need, not speculative.
2. ~~Truncate `commands.jsonl` at boot.~~ **DONE** — `gs_reset_io` clears `commands.jsonl` +
   `trace.jsonl` before `gs_launch` (see RESOLVED 3). ~~Make `tap`/`key`/`hold` validate key
   names.~~ **DONE** — `gs_drive` guards `gs_keycode`'s rc for `tap`/`seq`/`key`, and `hold` now
   passes the name through (no pre-resolution) + checks the press rc (RESOLVED 4). ~~Parse-time
   *presence* checks.~~ **DONE** — a step missing a required arg is a `--dry-run` lint error (see
   "Audit polish" below). Optional remainder: validate key *names* at parse time — deferred, would
   couple the pure parser to `gs_keycode` (`docs/ideas.md`).
3. The exec-caveat wording in the docs (README replay section + caveat box, finding #17,
   probe-design as-built, this handoff) was corrected 2026-06-16 to the direct-call/drive model —
   keep new docs consistent with it.

## git

Commits above are on **local master, not pushed** — and **interleaved with another session's
commits** (it was committing to master concurrently: `nexus` CLI, `dbvo` docs). Do NOT
`git push` blind; that would push the other session's possibly-unfinished work too. Coordinate
with Mase before pushing. Staging was precise per-file throughout (never `git add -A`).
