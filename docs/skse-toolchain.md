# The headless SKSE C++ toolchain (tier 2)

How a native **SKSE plugin** (a Windows `.dll`) gets built here entirely on Linux — no
Windows, no Visual Studio, no MSVC, no vcpkg. This is the second tier of headless modding
(tier 1 = Papyrus, see [papyrus-toolchain.md](papyrus-toolchain.md)); it exists because some engine behaviour
is unreachable from Papyrus (see [papyrus-limits.md](papyrus-limits.md)).

**Status: working, and shipping a real hook.** `mods/AutoFireBow/` builds a valid SKSE-shaped
`AutoFireBow.dll` against CommonLibSSE-NG, fully cross-compiled, and it loads in-game. It now
implements option 1 — a vtable hook on `ArrowProjectile::GetPowerSpeedMult` that forces full bow
charge for the player (verified in-game on 1.6.1170). See
[skse-tier-bringup.md](skse-tier-bringup.md) for the charge → power details.

## The idea

A SKSE plugin is an x86-64 PE DLL using the MSVC C++ ABI. You don't need MSVC to produce that —
`clang-cl` (Clang's MSVC-compatible driver) emits MSVC-ABI objects, `lld-link` links them into a
PE, and the Windows SDK + CRT headers/libs come from `xwin` (which downloads and repacks
Microsoft's redistributable SDK — no Windows install). CommonLibSSE-NG is pulled and built from
source by CMake's FetchContent, so there's no vcpkg either.

```
 .cpp ──clang-cl (--target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)──▶ .obj (MSVC ABI)
                       │ uses xwin's CRT + SDK headers (/imsvc)
 CommonLibSSE-NG ──────┤ (FetchContent: built the same way into CommonLibSSE.lib)
 spdlog ───────────────┤ (FetchContent)
                       ▼
                  lld-link  ──uses xwin's CRT + SDK libs (/libpath)──▶  AutoFireBow.dll (PE32+)
```

### Why `lld`/`llvm` are extracted, not pacman-installed

No passwordless sudo in the headless session. Pacman packages are just zstd tarballs, so the
`lld` and `llvm` packages (pinned to the exact installed `clang`/`llvm-libs` version, pulled from
`archive.archlinux.org`) were extracted into `~/.local/llvm-extra/usr/{bin,lib}`. `lld-link`
needs the `liblld*.so` from that prefix's `lib/`, which is why `cross-env.sh` puts it on
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If the system `clang`/`llvm-libs` is later upgraded, re-extract matching
`lld`/`llvm` (mismatched versions won't load).

## The two non-obvious fixes

Building MSVC-targeted C++ on Linux with Clang hits two issues that the toolchain handles:

1. **`-fdelayed-template-parsing`** (set in `cmake/clang-cl-msvc.cmake`). CommonLibSSE-NG has a
   few template methods with typos / missing members that are **never instantiated** — MSVC
   never compiles uninstantiated template bodies, so it never sees them. Clang does conforming
   current-instantiation name lookup at _parse_ time and rejects them. This flag defers body
   parsing to instantiation (MSVC semantics), so the dead code is never checked.

2. **PascalCase `.lib` symlinks** (`setup-sdk-symlinks.sh`, run automatically by `cross-env.sh`).
   `xwin` splats import libs under the exact casings in MS's manifest (`advapi32.lib`,
   `AdvAPI32.Lib`, …). CommonLibSSE references them PascalCase with a lowercase extension
   (`Advapi32.lib`, `Dbghelp.lib`, `Ole32.lib`, `Version.lib`). `lld-link` is case-sensitive on
   Linux, so the script adds the missing "capitalize-first-letter + `.lib`" symlink for every
   SDK lib. Idempotent, stamped at `$XWIN_SDK/.case-symlinks-done`.

| `tools/skse/cross-env.sh`               | Sourced before building. Puts the LLVM cross tools on `PATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, exports `XWIN_SDK`, ensures the `.lib` symlinks exist.                           |
| `tools/skse/setup-sdk-symlinks.sh`      | Creates the PascalCase `.lib` symlinks in the xwin SDK (called by `cross-env.sh`).                                                                               |
| `tools/skse/cmake/clang-cl-msvc.cmake`  | CMake toolchain file: sets the compiler/linker/ar/rc, the `/imsvc` include dirs, the `/libpath` lib dirs, `-fdelayed-template-parsing`, and cross-find settings. |
| `mods/AutoFireBow/CMakeLists.txt` | FetchContent for spdlog (`OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE`), rapidcsv (header, fed via `RAPIDCSV_INCLUDE_DIRS`), and CommonLibSSE-NG (pinned); builds `AutoFireBow.dll`.   |
| `mods/AutoFireBow/src/main.cpp`   | The plugin: declarative `SKSEPluginInfo` + `SKSEPluginLoad`, plus the vtable hook forcing full bow charge for the player.                                        |
| `mods/AutoFireBow/build.sh`       | One-shot configure + build (`--install` copies the DLL into the live game's `Data/SKSE/Plugins`).                                                                |

## Build it

```bash
cd mods/AutoFireBow
./build.sh            # -> build/AutoFireBow.dll (PE32+, x86-64)
./build.sh --install  # also copy into the game's Data/SKSE/Plugins
```

First configure clones CommonLibSSE-NG + spdlog + rapidcsv (~3 min); after that, FetchContent
is cached in `build/_deps` and rebuilds are incremental.

## One-time setup (if starting on a fresh machine)

1. **LLVM cross tools** → extract matching-version `lld` + `llvm` Arch packages into
   `~/.local/llvm-extra` (see "Why extracted" above), or `sudo pacman -S lld llvm` if you have root.
2. **xwin** → download the prebuilt binary to `~/.local/bin/xwin`, then:
   ```bash
   xwin --accept-license --arch x86_64 --cache-dir ~/.cache/xwin splat --output ~/.local/xwin-sdk
   ```
3. That's it — `cross-env.sh` wires the rest and creates the `.lib` symlinks on first build.

## Verifying a built DLL

```bash
source tools/skse/cross-env.sh
llvm-readobj --coff-exports mods/AutoFireBow/build/AutoFireBow.dll   # expect SKSEPlugin_{Load,Query,Version}
file mods/AutoFireBow/build/AutoFireBow.dll                          # expect PE32+ ... (DLL), x86-64
```

A loadable-DLL smoke test under wine (`LoadLibraryA` + `GetProcAddress` on the exports) confirms
the imports resolve. In-game loading needs SKSE + the Address Library installed.
