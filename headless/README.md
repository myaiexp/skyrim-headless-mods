# headless — drive Skyrim with no monitor, no hands

A way to run Skyrim SE **invisibly** (no window on any monitor), **screenshot** it on demand,
and **inject input** into it — all without touching your real keyboard/mouse/desktop. The point
is a tight test loop: instead of a human launching the game, loading a save, clicking a few
things, and reporting back, this harness lets an agent do it directly — load in, screenshot,
read the actual game state, press keys, confirm the result.

It's a **testing tool for this repo's mods** — the motivating case is `OneClickMap`, which makes a
world-map marker click fast-travel instantly (no confirmation popup). Testing it means **clicking a
discovered map marker**, so a working in-game **mouse** is the hard requirement (keyboard can't pick
an arbitrary marker). Long-term it pairs with the SKSE C++ tier: gamescope for _eyes_, and eventually
an in-process SKSE plugin for _hands + ground-truth state_.

> Status in one line: **invisible render + screenshots + isolated keyboard _and_ mouse all work.**
> Absolute `click <x> <y>` lands in-game (built on relative motion). See `docs/status.md`.

## How it works (the short version)

| Concern                    | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invisible + GPU render** | `gamescope --backend headless` — renders Skyrim to an offscreen buffer, no output on any monitor.                                                                 |
| **Screenshot**             | Send gamescope `SIGUSR2` → it writes `/tmp/gamescope_<ts>.avif`; convert to PNG. (X11 grabbers see only black — the game is Vulkan/DXVK.)                         |
| **Input**                  | **libei** via gamescope's `gamescope-0-ei` socket. Relative-native, evdev keycodes, scoped to that session — **cannot leak to your seat**.                        |
| **Isolation**              | A headless gamescope has no host seat, so injected input never reaches your real cursor/keyboard. Measured: XTEST into the session left the real pointer unmoved. |

Full rationale in [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md). The expensive dead-ends (and why each
failed) are in [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md) — **read that before changing the approach.**

## Layout

| Path               | What                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `launch.sh`        | Start Skyrim+SKSE in a headless gamescope (the `SteamAppId` fix is baked in). Writes the real gamescope pid to `/tmp/headless-skyrim.pid`.                                      |
| `ready.sh`         | Block until **fully in-world** (interactive) — polls SkytestProbe `status` for `inWorld:true`. Use this instead of `pgrep SkyrimSE.exe` (it spawns late) to know when to drive. |
| `shot.sh`          | `SIGUSR2` → newest gamescope AVIF → PNG (optional crop/scale).                                                                                                                  |
| `drive.sh`         | Friendly wrapper over `src/eidriver` (`tap enter`, `seq down down enter`, `click x y`, `abs x y`, `rel`).                                                                       |
| `stop.sh`          | Kill the session cleanly — by gamescope **session** (pidfile), so it's safe alongside a Skyrim you're playing in the same prefix (Steam blocks a 2nd game anyway; finding #12). |
| `src/eidriver.c`   | The libei input client. Keyboard ✅, mouse ✅ (absolute click via relative).                                                                                                    |
| `src/build.sh`     | `gcc` + `pkg-config libei-1.0`. No sudo.                                                                                                                                        |
| `docs/design.md`   | Architecture + why each piece.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `docs/findings.md` | Every wall we hit and the reason.                                                                                                                                               |
| `docs/status.md`   | What works, what's left, next steps.                                                                                                                                            |

## Quick start

```bash
cd headless
src/build.sh                       # compile the libei input client (once)
./launch.sh                        # start Skyrim headless (writes the gamescope pidfile)
./ready.sh                         # block until in-world (interactive); ~1-2 min
./shot.sh /tmp/sky.png             # capture the current frame
./drive.sh seq down down enter     # keyboard-navigate the menu (CONTINUE->NEW->LOAD, then activate)
./drive.sh click 1195 556          # OR mouse: click a pixel directly (absolute, lands in-game)
./shot.sh /tmp/sky2.png            # see the result
./stop.sh                          # tear it down
```

## Requirements (all already present on this machine, no root)

`gamescope`, `libei` (+ header at `/usr/include/libei-1.0`, resolved by `pkg-config`), `gcc`,
ImageMagick (`magick`). A Skyrim SE + SKSE install (launcher swapped to SKSE; prefix is currently
Proton Experimental). `sudo` is **not** available here — everything is user-space/compiled.
